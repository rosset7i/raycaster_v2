# Raycaster_v2

A 2D raycasting engine written in **Rust** — a simple Wolfenstein-like renderer that casts rays into a grid map, calculates distances to walls, and draws a projected view.

This project was created as a **learning exercise in graphics and rendering**, focusing on understanding the core raycasting algorithm and separating logic from graphics APIs.

## 🧠 Motivation

This project exists to:

- Learn how raycasting works from first principles
- Explore graphics concepts
